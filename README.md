# OVERVIEW
This project explores a citation network using classical analysis techniques, community detection, and link prediction.

## Classical Analysis
Classical analysis techniques, such as centrality measures and clustering, were applied to gain insights into the structure and characteristics of the citation network.

## Community Detection
Compared Random Walk based methods to Graph Neural Networks for this task and analyzed the differences in the result obtained.

## Link Prediction
Compared Node2Vec algorithm to a Graph Convolutional Network for predicting links in a transductive setting.
